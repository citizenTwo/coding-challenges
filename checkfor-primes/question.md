# Check for Primes

Create a function that filters prime numbers from an array of integers.

## Requirements
- Implement `filterPrimes(numbers: number[]): number[]`
- The function should return a new array containing only the prime numbers from the input array.
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Example
```typescript
const result = filterPrimes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);

// Result will be:
[2, 3, 5, 7]
```
